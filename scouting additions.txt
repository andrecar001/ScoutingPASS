reorganize such that questions follow logically:
- questions asking about the same thing follow eachother
- - EX: ask if able to climb -> climb time -> single / double climb
- - EX: what do in auto -> auto score ammount -> eachother
Was the same as last year pretty much. Good for freshman because they get to know people.
it was fine but it was hard to find where they started from
I didnt do much of it but from what I ended up doing, It was alright
pretty easy to use 
it was fine but there should be an option for "they dont know"
It worked out well, but it was hard to remember when to add how someone grabbed a gamepeice when the end came quick
I have no complaints about the match scouting forms
I thought the format was really good and liked how the forms were organized
