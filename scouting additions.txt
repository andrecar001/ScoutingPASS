add height
Asking for a good driver is stupid
good defense to offense/defense
'autostart' and 'shooting preference'
gear ratio L3,L2,L1
stage timer to climb time
ask about human player - (designated person)?
cycle time
remove radio for where they can score, turn into checkboxes
teleop scores radio for where they can shoot "alot, little, don't know"
make it better :3
what are they doing in auto textbox
>:(
